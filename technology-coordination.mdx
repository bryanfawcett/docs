## Professional Philosophy

<div className="mt-8 p-6 bg-blue-50 dark:bg-blue-900 rounded-lg">
  <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-3">Technology in Education: Beyond Tools</h3>
  
  <p className="mb-4">My approach to technology coordination in educational settings is guided by these core principles:</p>
  
  <div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3 gap-6">
    <div>
      <h4 className="font-medium mb-2">Pedagogy First</h4>
      <p className="text-sm">Technology implementations should always serve educational objectives. The starting point is understanding how technology can enhance teaching and learning, not implementing technology for its own sake.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div>
      <h4 className="font-medium mb-2">Inclusive Design</h4>
      <p className="text-sm">Technology solutions must be accessible to all users regardless of technical proficiency or learning differences. Training and support are as important as the technology itself.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div>
      <h4 className="font-medium mb-2">Sustainable Implementation</h4>
      <p className="text-sm">Educational technology should be implemented with long-term sustainability in mind, considering future growth, changing requirements, and ongoing support needs.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  
  <p className="mt-6 italic">"Technology in education is not about replacing traditional methods but enhancing them. The most successful implementations are those that empower educators and students rather than constrain them with technological limitations."</p>
