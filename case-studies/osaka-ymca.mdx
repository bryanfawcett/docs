# Osaka YMCA International School: Educational Technology Transformation

<Note>
  This case study details my experience as Technology Coordinator at Osaka YMCA International School, where I led comprehensive digital transformation initiatives while supporting the opening of a new high school campus.
</Note>

## Organization Overview

<div className="p-5 bg-blue-50 dark:bg-blue-900 rounded-lg mb-6">
  <p>Osaka YMCA International School (OYIS) is an IB World School located in Osaka, Japan, offering the Primary Years Programme (PYP), Middle Years Programme (MYP), and Diploma Programme (DP) to a diverse international student body. As a growing international school, OYIS was expanding its programs and opening a new high school campus during my tenure, creating opportunities for significant technology enhancement.</p>
</div>

## Challenge

When I joined Osaka YMCA International School as Technology Coordinator, the institution faced several technological challenges:

- Limited digital integration with primarily paper-based administrative processes
- Inconsistent classroom technology implementation across grade levels
- Need for comprehensive IT infrastructure for the new high school campus
- Lack of standardized educational platforms for curriculum management
- Limited systems for parent communication and student admissions
- Manual financial processes requiring digital transformation
